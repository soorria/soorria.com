Sometimes you have 2 packages / modules with the same imports, but VSCode keeps
suggesting the wrong one. This eslint config raises an error if you import from
specified packages, and if you want, you can limit the error to specific
imports.

This works with eslint v8 or v9, and you can use either the
[built-in rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-restricted-imports) or
the
[typescript plugin's version](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-restricted-imports/)
which lets you blanket allow / disallow type imports.

```js
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    /**
     * This uses the built-in rule, but you can change this to
     * '@typescript-eslint/no-restricted-imports' if you have the typescript
     * plugin installed. Remember to also the `'no-restricted-imports': off`
     * rule to prevent conflicts between the 2 rules.
     */
    'no-restricted-imports': [
      'error',
      {
        paths: [
          {
            name: 'CHANGE THIS TO THE BAD PACKAGE NAME',
            message:
              "Import from 'CHANGE THIS TO THE PACKAGE YOU WANT IMPORTED' instead :)",
            /**
             * Optional, if you want the error to apply to specific imports
             * instead of every import.
             */
            importNames: ['badImportA'],

            /**
             * Optional, allow all type imports from the module. Only applies
             * if using the typescript plugin version
             */
            allowTypeImports: true,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

<Note variant="warning">

Unfortunately, this **does not** prevent the invalid packages from showing up in
autocomplete - it just prevent bad imports by erroring when eslint runs.

</Note>

## Example

To error on imports from `'node:test'` when you're actually using
[`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/)

```js
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    'no-restricted-imports': [
      'error',
      {
        paths: [
          {
            name: 'node:test',
            message: "Import from 'vitest' instead :)",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```
