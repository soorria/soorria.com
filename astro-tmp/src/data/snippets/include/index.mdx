A more inclusive complement to TypeScript's
[`Exclude`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#excludeuniontype-excludedmembers)
helper type - only include the parts of a union type that are assignable to
another type.

```ts
export type Include<T, U> = T extends U ? T : never
```

## Usage

```ts
type OpenAIMessage =
  | {
      role: 'user'
      content: string
    }
  | {
      role: 'ai'
      content?: string
      function_call?: {
        name: string
        arguments: string
      }
    }

/**
 * This type is now only the user part of the message.
 */
type UserMessage = Include<OpenAIMessage, { role: 'user' }>
```
