See [debounce](/snippets/debounce) if you want your function to run at the end
of the N seconds.

```typescript
const throttle = <T extends CallableFunction>(fn: T, delay: number): T => {
  let canRun = true

  return ((...args: any[]) => {
    if (canRun) {
      fn(...args)
      canRun = false
      setTimeout(() => {
        canRun = true
      }, delay)
    }
  }) as any
}
```
