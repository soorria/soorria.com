This stops Vercel's GitHub Bot from commenting on your PRs and commits, and so
also stops the emails you get when that happens. This **does not** stop Vercel
creating deploys for PRs and commits.

To use, add the following to your project's `vercel.json`, or create the file if
you haven't already. Unlike some of the other Vercel
[Project Configuration options](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration),
this options must be added to the `vercel.json` even in a Next.js project.data.

```json title="vercel.json" {2-4}
{
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

See the documentation for this config option
[here](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#git-configuration/github-silent).

## Examples

Here are a few examples from some of my projects, with and without other options
in the `vercel.json`:

- [This website, a Next.js app](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/vercel.json)
- [A Remix app](https://github.com/soorria/utils/blob/main/vercel.json)
- [A SolidJS SPA with Vite](https://github.com/soorria/pokelife/blob/master/vercel.json)

## Easy Usage

<Note variant="warning">
  This only works correctly if you don't already have a `vercel.json` in your
  folder.
</Note>

Copy the following snippet and run in your shell from the root of the git repo /
app. It will:

1. Create a `vercel.json` file with the above JSON.
2. Commit and push it to your git repo.

```bash
cat > vercel.json <<EOF
{
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
EOF

git add vercel.json
git commit -m "stop vercel's github bot comment on commits"
git push
```
