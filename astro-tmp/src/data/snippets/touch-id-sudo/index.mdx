Turns out on MacOS you can use Touch ID to authenticate `sudo` commands! No clue
about the security implications of this though. To enable, add a file at
`/etc/pam.d/sudo_local` with the following content, and then restart your
computer.

```text title="/etc/pam.d/sudo_local"
auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so
```

<Note variant="warning">

In the `/etc/pam.d/` directory, there's another file called `sudo`, but you
**should not** add the lines above to the it. Changes to that file may not
survive OS updates.
