Recently at [work](https://relevanceai.com), I encountered a couple issues where
our frontend was failing to load in our development environment, but we had no
clue about the cause, or which commit introduced the bug! I could have manually
checked each commit until I found the offending one, but that would have been
time-consuming and more importantly **boring**. Instead, I used `git bisect` and
its subcommands to quickly find the causal commit, and diagnose the issue!

## How to use it

1. Get started by running the following:

   ```console
   git bisect start
   ```

   This will start the binary search of your git history,

1. Checkout a branch, or commit where you're 100% sure is buggy.

   ```console
   git checkout <branch or commit hash>
   ```

   There's a decent chance it's the current branch you're on if the bug exists
   your latest code, and if so you can just skip this step.

   Now, mark the branch as "bad":

   ```console
   git bisect bad
   ```

1. Find a commit you're sure **is not** buggy. A good way to do this is to find
   a time without the bug, and use `git log` to find a commit around that time.
   It's okay if the commit is too old - since `git bisect` does a binary search
   you won't have that many extra iterations! Mark this commit as "good":

   ```console
   git bisect good <commit hash>
   ```

   Now, we're ready to binary search! After you run the command above, you
   should see something like the following in your console:

   ```console
   Bisecting: 311 revisions left to test after this (roughly 8 steps)
   [d0f8d96ef806c440d4d2bce0bb56244540fd292f] Do a thing with code :)
   ```

1. Check if the bug exists in the current commit - run unit / integration / E2E
   tests, or just manually check if the bug exists. If the bug exists, run

   ```console
   git bisect bad
   ```

   Otherwise, if the bug doesn't exist in the current commit, run

   ```console
   git bisect good
   ```

   Repeat this step until you see a message like

   ```console
   14ff3ae7ab1403ec630e831d68cd8307e9ce982a is the first bad commit
   commit 14ff3ae7ab1403ec630e831d68cd8307e9ce982a
   Author: Soorria Saruva <soorria.ss@gmail.com>
   Date:   Mon Aug 29 13:33:37 2022 +1000

       add bugs

   path/to/real-file.txt | 2 +-
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
   ```

1. Fix the bug! Git checks out the commit for you

## Automating the boring bits away

Step 4 above is the most time-consuming and boring part of this process. If you
can check if the bug exists without manually checking functionality (e.g.
running tests), `git bisect` can run the command for you and automatically mark
commits as "good" and "bad". To do this, run

```console
git bisect run <command that checks if bug exists>
```

<Note variant="info">

- The command must return a non-zero exit code if the commit should be marked as
  "bad". If you're using a testing framework, it probably already does this.

- **Do not** quote the whole command. For example, if you want to run
  `npm run test`, your `git bisect` command should be

  ```console
  git bisect run npm run test
  ```

  and **not**

  ```console
  git bisect run "npm run test"
  ```

</Note>
