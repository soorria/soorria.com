## What and Why

Event delegation allows you to add a single event listener to a parent element,
rather than adding event listeners to each child elements. This is useful when
the child elements (e.g. a list of buttons) change or there are lots of them. It
can also be a bit more performant, and frameworks like
[React](https://reactjs.org/) use it for all `click` events with the `onClick`
prop.

## How

Event delegation exploits a behaviour of the DOM's event system - event
_bubbling_. When an event (e.g. a `click` event) happens, your browser drills
down to the smallest element affected by the event (e.g. clicked on) - the
event's `target`. The browser then <Sparkles>_bubbles_</Sparkles> the event up
the DOM tree, firing an event on every parent!

## Example

Let's try it out on this UI which should `alert` with some information when any
of the buttons is clicked.

```html
<div id="elements-list">
  <button>
    <img src="/water-tribe.png" />
    Water
  </button>
  <button>
    <img src="/earth-kingdom.png" />
    Earth
  </button>
  <button>
    <img src="/fire-nation.png" />
    Fire
  </button>
  <button>
    <img src="/air-temple.png" />
    Air
  </button>
</div>
```

### Adding an Event Listener

The _default_ way to do this would be to select all of the buttons, and add an
event listener to each of them. However, since we're using _event delegation_,
we'll add a `'click'` event listener to the parent:

```ts
const list = document.getElementById('elements-list')!

list.addEventListener('click', event => {
  // this is where we'll handle the buttons being clicked
})
```

### Getting the Clicked Button

Okay, so we've added the event listener how do we get the actual button that was
clicked? The event fired when an action occurs has two properties that can help
us:

- `event.currentTarget` - This is the element that we added the event to. In
  this case, it's the surrounding `<div>`
- `event.target` - This is the deepest element that was clicked.

Looking at the two options above, it seems like `event.target` is perfect, but
in the example above we have a little issue. If a user clicks a button, but
their mouse is over the image, `event.target` will be the `<img>`! Obviously, we
_could_ just remove the icons, but they'll look nice and that's important to me.
Instead, we'll use the
[`closest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)
method available on all HTML elements. It accepts a CSS selector (just like
`querySelector`) and walks up the DOM tree until it finds an element that
matches the selector, or runs out of elements. This allows us to the get the
button that was clicked _even if_ the deepest clicked element is something else!

```ts
list.addEventListener('click', event => {
  const clickedButton = (event.target as Element).closest('button')

  // Check in case there isn't a parent matching the selector
  if (!clickedButton) {
    return
  }
})
```

<Note variant='info'>

Notice above that we return early if `event.target.closest` returns a falsy
value. We do this since:

1. If a user clicks a part of the containing element (in this case the
   surrounding `<div>`), and their mouse isn't also over a button (e.g. if
   there's some spacing between the buttons), it will return `null``.
2. **TypeScript only**: The return type of `event.target.closest` is defined
   similar to `HTMLElement | null`, so if the return value is unchecked you will
   have type errors (and lose autocomplete) when using it.

</Note>

### Showing the `alert`

We can finally show the alert, but we have a little issue. We have the button
that was clicked, but how do we know _which_ specific button was clicked? We
need a way to distinguish them from each other. In this example, we'll use
[data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)
since their values are easy to access in JavaScript, and there's a no chance for
conflicts with any attributes added to browsers in the future.

You can use any data attribute, but since the buttons in this example are for
bending elements from
[Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
I'll use `data-element`.

```html
<button data-element="water">
  <!-- water button contents -->
</button>
<button data-element="earth">
  <!-- earth button contents -->
</button>
<button data-element="fire">
  <!-- fire button contents -->
</button>
<button data-element="air">
  <!-- air button contents -->
</button>
```

Now, we can access the value of the `data-element` attribute using the `dataset`
property on every element:

```ts
const elementForClickedButton = clickedButton.dataset.element
```

### Putting it all together

Putting all the above steps together we have our JavaScript

```ts
const list = document.getElementById('elements-list')!

list.addEventListener('click', event => {
  const clickedButton = event.target.closest('button')

  // Check in case there isn't a parent matching the selector
  if (!clickedButton) {
    return
  }

  // Get the value from the `data-element` attribute
  const bendingElementForClickedButton = clickedButton.dataset.element

  showAlertForElement(bendingElementForClickedButton)
})
```

and our HTML (now with alt attributes!)

```html
<div id="elements-list">
  <button data-element="water">
    <img
      src="/water-tribe.png"
      alt="line art, crashing waves inside a circle representing water bending"
    />
    Water
  </button>
  <button data-element="earth">
    <img
      src="/earth-kingdom.png"
      alt="line art, rock-like trapezium with swirl inside representing earth bending"
    />
    Earth
  </button>
  <button data-element="fire">
    <img
      src="/fire-nation.png"
      alt="line art, three-pronged flamed with a swirl in the centre representing fire bending"
    />
    Fire
  </button>
  <button data-element="air">
    <img
      src="/air-temple.png"
      alt="line art, three swirls organised in an upside-down triangle representing airbending"
    />
    Air
  </button>
</div>
```

## Demo

Here's a demo with the icons, and _a_ complete, useful and 100% non-trivial
`showAlertForElement` implementation:
