1. Find a picture of your ~victim~ volunteer to be emoji-fied. Ideally, the
   subject of the picture is horizontally centered and bottom-aligned in the
   image.

   <Image
     src="/img/partyify-anyone/good-bad-starting-image-cmp.png"
     width={1027}
     height={481}
   />

1. Remove the background of the image (you could do this without removing the
   background, but imo the result is worse):

   - If you're on Mac, Preview is great at this. Just open the image in Preview,
     and press <kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd></kbd>, or
     click `Tools > Remove Background` in the Menu Bar. It's not perfect, but
     it's free and easily accessible

   - If you're not on a Mac, you can use an online tool like
     [Canva's Online Background Remover](https://www.canva.com/features/background-remover/)
     (1 free image) or manually using an image editor like
     [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) (free with ads) or
     [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) (one-time free
     per major version).

1. Opeh up [my slightly-nicer-to-use fork](https://partyify.soorria.com) of Nate
   Watson's "Party-ify" (original version
   [here](https://nathanielw.github.io/party-ify/)), and upload your image. If
   you're using my fork you can drag the image onto the page :).
1. Change the settings until you see what you like in the preview. Generally I
   recommend using the "centered" wavey style for people, and the "bounce" style
   for logos, and leaving the other options as Nate's awesome defaults.
1. When you're happy with the results, scroll down to and click the "Generate
   GIF" button to ... generate a gif of your new emoji.
1. Add the emoji to wherever you want to use it:

   - [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036479811-Custom-Emojis)
