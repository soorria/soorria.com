- className, htmlFor
- forcing inputs' values to match their `value` props makes things more
  intuitive
- but react does patch over other things to make things a bit easier / more
  intuitive, e.g.
  - oninput, onchange, etc -> onChange
  - whitespace in jsx isn't preserved - only in the strings you add, unlike in
    html
- more of a JSX thing, but self-closing tags work different:
  https://jakearchibald.com/2023/against-self-closing-tags-in-html/
- events differences:
  https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#react-event-object
- form action prop as function
- head elements get automatically moved to the `<head>`

  - https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/link
    - links are also automatically deduped
  - https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/meta
  - https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/script
    - `<script async src="...">` only
  - https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/style
    - additional `precedence` prop to handle ordering for CSS cascade
  - https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/title#set-the-document-title
    - children needs to be a single string, otherwise React will Error

- this makes things easier, but could lead to people becoming "React" developers
  vs web developers - i.e. people learning the framework instead of learning the
  platform
- not how things work in general
