  How I discovered the secrets of the TMNT stack, built 
  this website and procrastinated uni course work for 2 years.

I've spent way too much of the last 2 years tweaking this website and now, after
a friend built [his website](https://ericpaul.me?ref=soorria.com) in 2 weeks and
published the obligatory
["How I built my website"](https://www.ericpaul.me/blogs/ericpaul.me) post, I'm
finally documenting all the crimes I've committed while making this website. The
[repo](https://soorria.com/src) for this website is public so you can poke
around and witness the horrors first hand.

## The Stack 🥞

The main technological pillars of this website are:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

...aka the TMNT stack!!1!1!!

---

On a _slightly_ more serious note, I'll talk about most of the important tech
used in this website in the rest of the article below, but if you want a TL;DR
you can look through the
[`package.json`](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/package.json).

## The Code

The vast majority of this website is written in TypeScript since it provides a
significant quality of life boost for a minor initial investment. If only the
stocks I invest in had a similar ROI.

React is my ~framework~ library of choice with Next.js. This combo is extremely
okay for my use-case (a mostly static site) thought I didn't know this when I
started. The main reasons I chose the pair are:

- They were the first I learned.
- Next.js SSR / SSG was easier to understand and hack around than Gatsby's
  graphql + plugin system.

This combo also happens to be pretty okay performance-wise (though unfortunately
not on the level of [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) or [Astro](https://astro.build)) with a 78 on
mobile and a <Sparkles>100</Sparkles> on desktop with
[PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev)' synthetic tests for my home
page:

<Image
  src="/img/overengineering-a-website-sep-2022/pagespeed-desktop.png"
  width={1916}
  height={494}
  alt="pagespeed.web.dev showing a 100 score on desktop for https://soorria.com"
/>

Now that I've used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with
[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) with
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and
[SolidStart](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start), I would probably choose to
use SolidJS once SolidStart is ready and I might even switch this site over as
soon as it is.

## Making it Pretty

The styling for this website it mainly done with Tailwind CSS, but I've made a
few simple changes to the base theme:

- Adding the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) colours.
- Adding a `display` font family with
  [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as the first font.
- Overriding the `mono` font family with
  [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as the first font.

For plugins, I've added the
[`@tailwindcss/typography`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)
plugin which makes posts like this one look pretty with a single `.prose`.

Another plugin I use is what I like to call the <Sparkles>Hocus
Plugin</Sparkles> (sparkles are required). It's a plugin that's great for lazy
people like me who make their `:hover` and `:focus` states basically they same,
adding the `hocus:` variant which will add the associated styles on hover and
focus. It also adds `hocus-within`, `group-hocus`, and `group-hocus-within`
which are similar but based of slightly different existing variants.

  While writing this post I decided to procrastinate and add a [snippet for this
  plugin](/snippets/tailwindcss-hocus).

## The Content

Most websites have some sort of content. On this site, the content is mainly
text with some code blocks, and fewer interactive-ish demos. Additionally I want
to be able to edit some things (all on the home page) without needing to
re-deploy my site. To suit my needs the content for this site is written in MDX
and sourced either from the git repo, or a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
"CMS" instance.

### <Sparkles>MDX</Sparkles>

MDX is markdown on steroids. It lets you embed React components in your
markdown, giving you _way_ more flexibility than normal markdown. There are a
few ways to _use_ MDX with next.js:

1. [`@next/mdx`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx) -
   A first-party Next.js "plugin" that lets you use `.mdx` files as routes in
   your `pages` folder.
2. [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) - A library
   from HashiCorp designed for, but not limited to, Next.js that compiles your
   mdx text server-side, and lets you render it in a React component. This is
   what I initially used but switched off in favour of ...
3. [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) - A library by
   [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) that **_bundles_** your mdx text
   server-side and also lets you render it in a React component. This is what I
   use right now.

Looking at the options above, `@next/mdx` seems like the easiest solution, but
it's also the least flexible. On my site there are places I use MDX where the
rendered content _isn't_ the page's main content. Take for example the home
page. The [subtitle paragraph](/#hero-subtitle) and the ["now" paragraph](/#now)
below it are rendered from MDX allowing me to use the `<Sparkles />` component
in it _AND_ change out what the text says without needing to re-deploy.

Now that we've discarded option 1, you might be wondering why, after building my
site with `next-mdx-remote` I switched to `mdx-bundler`. After all, both allow
you to provide custom components to use in your MDX and let you add a bunch of
plugins to modify the behaviour of your markdown and intermediate html. The
reason is the bolded and italicised word in 3/ that's also part of the name of
the library - **_bundling_**.

When `next-mdx-remote` compiles your MDX, it converts your MDX to JavaScript
that can run in your browser (with React), but it doesn't (and can't) deal with
anything imported from other files. While this isn't a deal-breaker for most, it
means that when you provide a custom component to your MDX in a parameterised
route, the cost of the component is incurred in every page. This is bad when
some pages have custom components like
[this demo](/snippets/use-local-storage#demo) which are useless on other pages.
`mdx-bundler` solves this issue by a) enabling imports in your MDX text and b)
compiling and joining only the parts used in a piece of MDX into its final
output. That is, it bundles your MDX text and any of its dependencies. This
results in fewer bytes sent over the wire for each page, this letting me built
custom demos and examples without worrying about destroying performance on other
pages.

### MDX Plugins

The base features of MDX might be enough for most sites - but not for an
over-engineered on like this. All the MDX rendering libraries mentioned above
allow you to add [`remark`](https://remark.js.org/) and
[`rehype`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) to ~play around with~ modify the
intermediate markdown and html syntax trees respectively.

#### Remark Plugins

These are the `remark` plugins I use in order:

- [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) - Adds support for
  [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) with additions
  like ~strikethrough~ and tables!
- [`remarkTypescriptTransform`](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/src/lib/remark.server.ts) -
  A custom remark plugin I wrote to create a version of every TypeScript code
  block that is transpiled to JavaScript. It then wraps the pair of code blocks
  in my `<TsJsSwitcher />` component which handles conditionally showing the
  correct version of the code block.
- [`remark-shiki-twoslash`](https://github.com/shikijs/twoslash/tree/main/packages/remark-shiki-twoslash) -
  Highlights code blocks with the [`shiki`](https://shiki.matsu.io/) syntax
  highlighter - which uses the same underlying highlighter as VSCode. This needs
  to be _after_ the `remarkTypescriptTransform` plugin so the original
  TypeScript code block can be transpiled, and so the JavaScript copy of the
  code block is highlighted the original TypeScript code block can be
  transpiled, and so the JavaScript copy of the code block is highlighted.

The `remarkTypescriptTransform` and `remark-shiki-twoslash` plugins are only
used if the MDX text _might_ contain code blocks. I chose to do this since the
highlighting and transform took too long for the home page (added close to 1
extra second!!), and due to how Vercel handles deployment outputs rebuilds of
the home page would fail due to missing language grammars.

#### Rehype Plugins

These are the `rehype` plugins I use in order:

- [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw) - A plugin that
  re-parses nodes in the rehype tree as html. This is required to use the
  `remark-shiki-twoslash` plugin as it outputs as html string rather than mdast
  nodes, nad MDX cannot correctly interpret it.
- [`rehype-slug`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug) - Adds `id`s to every
  heading in MDX content where the value is a slugified version of the heading
  text.
- [`rehypeRearrangeShikiOutput`](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/src/lib/rehype.server.ts) -
  A custom rehype plugin that rearranges the html output of
  `remark-shiki-twoslash` as it adds a few extra layers of html tags that aren't
  very easy to replace with custom MDX components. It transforms `shiki`'s code
  block output from

  ```html {0-2,6-7}
  <pre class="shiki dracula">
    <div class='language-id'>ts</div>
    <div class='code-container'>
      <code>
        <!-- Highlighted code lines here  -->
      </code>
    </div>
  </pre>
  ```

  to

  ```html {0,4}
  <pre class="shiki dracula" language="ts">
    <code>
      <!-- Highlighted code lines here  -->
    </code>
  </pre>
  ```

  which is flatter and does more work at build-time to reduce work at runtime
  and client-side.

- [`rehype-autolink-headings`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-autolink-headings) -
  Adds links to each heading so you can share links to specific parts of a page.
  You can see the link if you hover over any heading in this page except the one
  at the top - e.g. hover over the `Rehype Plugins` heading above and you'll see
  a `#` appear to the right.
- [`rehype-accessible-emojis`](https://github.com/GaiAma/Coding4GaiAma/tree/master/packages/rehype-accessible-emojis) -
  Wraps emoji in a `<span>` with an appropriate `aria-label` attribute.

### "CMS" #1 - the `_data` Folder

As the name suggests, the
[`_data`](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/_data) folder is
where the vast majority of the data / content on this site is stored. The
general structure of this folder is:

```
_data
└  [type]
   └  [slug]
      ├  index.mdx
      └  components.js
```

- `[type]` is one of `'blog'`, `'misc'`, `'projects'` or `'snippets'`.
- `[slug]` is what gets used in the url for the page. Using the file system for
  this means that I get unique slugs for free!!
- `index.mdx` is where the MDX text and frontmatter goes.
- `components.js` is an optional file from which the adjacent `index.mdx` file
  can import components specific to that page.

### "CMS" #2 - Supabase

For things that I want to be able to change _without_ re-deploying the site, I
use a Supabase instance with the following schema (as SQL):

```sql
create table singletons (
  id int8 generated by default as identity primary key,
  slug text unique not null,
  context text default '',
  public boolean default true
);
```

I also made a secret "CMS" frontend and set up row level security rules so that
only I can create, update and delete rows.

The format of the text in the `content` column depends on my needs:

- For the [hero](/#hero) on the home page I want to be able to change out the
  text, and previously I wanted to be able to control whether there was a hover
  interaction. For this, the `content` is a JSON blob.

- For the [subtitle](/#hero-subtitle) on the home page I want to have several
  options that are compiled as MDX and can be randomly cycled through
  client-side. For this, the `content` is a list of paragraphs separated by
  `---`s.

## Going Live

This website is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). It's probably the best
place to deploy your Next.js apps - static pages are deployed to CDNs, while
more dynamic ones are deploy to serverless functions and edge functions /
middleware are deployed to
[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). Every commit is
automatically built and deployed, and the CDN cache is invalidate, saving me
from needing to set up complicated CI/CD pipelines and from one of the most
difficult problems in programming. On top of all that, they have an extremely
generous [free tier](https://vercel.com/pricing).

The only downside is that Vercel's bot comments on every commit, so GitHub sends
you emails but there's a [very easy fix](/snippets/stop-vercel-github-comments).

## Random S#!t

### Updating _Without_&nbsp; Re-Deploying

As I've mentioned a few times in this post, I want to be able to change aspects
of my home page without needing to wait a few minutes for a deploy. Next.js
greatly simplifies this on pages using
[`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) -
Next.js' API for fetching data at build-time. By providing a value for the
[`revalidate`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-props#revalidate)
property, Next.js will re-fetch data, re-generate that specific page, and
invalidate the page's CDN cache at most once every _n_ seconds specified.

### Tab Icons, Titles, Descriptions

I'm not an SEO pro, but it's nice (and useful) to be able to set the tab icon
(aka favicon), title, description and other metadata for pages. Social Sharing
Image, also known as "OpenGraph Images" are the images you sometimes see when
you share a link on services like Twitter, Messenger and Discord. You can also
configure _how_ Twitter shows your website when linked with the following
`<meta>` tags:

These can all be set by adding the following tags, with appropriate values in
the `<head>` of your document:

```html
<!-- Page Title -->
<title>
  Over-Engineering a Website (September 2022) | Blog • Soorria Saruva
</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="Cool blog post" />

<!-- Page Description -->
<meta name="description" content="Cool blog post description" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Cool blog post description" />

<!-- Page URL -->
<meta property="og:url" content="https://soorria.com/posts/cool-blog-post" />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://soorria.com/posts/cool-blog-post" />

<!-- Favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png" />

<!-- Sharing Image URL -->
<meta
  property="og:image"
  content="https://soorria.com/api/og?title=Over-Engineering%20a%20Website%20(September%202022)&subtitle=soorria.com%2Fblog%20"
/>

<!-- Sharing Image Dimensions -->
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" />
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630" />

<!-- Twitter Sharing Configuration -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@soorriously" />
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@soorriously" />
```

I use the awesome [`next-seo`](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) package
which simplifies the process of setting and managing the tags above.
Additionally, I use
[`next-sitemap`](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap) to create a
sitemap for this website a build-time which _I think_ helps web crawlers.

### Generating Social Sharing Images

You can have noticed that value of the `content` attribute for `og:image`
doesn't point to a `.png`, `.jpg` or any other image file (at least directly).
Instead, it points to:

```
https://soorria.com/api/og?title=Over-Engineering%20a%20Website%20(September%202022)&subtitle=soorria.com%2Fblog%20
```

You'll notice that the url seems to contain the page's `title` and a `subtitle`
it is designed create customisable images on-demand like this one:

<Image
  src="/api/og?title=Image%20for%20Demo&subtitle=Over-Engineering%20a%20Website"
  width={1200}
  height={630}
  alt="pagespeed.web.dev showing a 100 score on desktop for https://soorria.com"
/>

I use these in a serverless function on Vercel to _generate_ a new image for
each page with the following process:

1. Start up a _headless_ chrome browser with a width of 1200px and a height of
   630px.
2. Navigate to `https://soorria.com/og/{title}/{subtitle}` in the headless
   browser. This is a set of routes server-side rendered at runtime, and
   generates the equivalent HTML and CSS for how I want OpenGraph images too
   look.
3. Take a screenshot of the headless browser's content in the `.png` format.
4. Send the image as the response. I also add the following headers to cache the
   generated images for a whole year in Vercel's CDN and set the corrent
   response type:
   ```
   Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000
   Content-Type: image/png
   ```

There is one pretty big downside with this process - when an image is first
generate it will take a few seconds due to the serverless function's cold start,
and the time required to spin up a chrome browser, load the page and take the
screenshot, but this is generally mitigated by the caching implemented in
step 4.

The source code for this is available
[here](https://github.com/soorria/og-gen/blob/main/api/og.ts). If you click on
the link, you may notice that it's in a different repo despite the final
`og:image` url pointing to a route on the `soorria.com` domain! The serverless
function defined in the link above is actually deployed to
`https://og-gen-lovat.vercel.app/api/og` and requests to
`https://soorria.com/api/og` are rewritten in this site's
[`next.config.js`](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/next.config.js).

This complicated process brings up the question of why have the image generation
in another repo and deployed to another site. The answer is a trade-off due to
Vercel's deployment process. As mentioned in the [Going Live](#going-live)
section above, when a new version of the site is deployed Vercel wipes out the
CDN cache for the previous deployment. This means that if I kept the generation
in the same repo, and in the same site, any time I re-deployed all previously
generated images would need to be generated again.

### Link Tree?

Who ever decided to call these things Link _Trees_ has obviously been outside
[less than programmers](https://i.redd.it/zf19wzbcjer51.png) - they don't even
look like trees! In any case, I have a list of links available at
[/links](/links), but also at [links.soorria.com](https://links.soorria.com). I
use Next.js' awesome
[middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware) feature for
this. In
[`middleware.ts`](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/src/middleware.ts)
I rewrite any pages on select subdomains (like `links.soorria.com`) to the
`/links` page.
