`Promise.all()` is a super useful function that takes a list of promises and
returns a promise that resolves to the results of each of the promises. Most
importantly, it returns the results of your promises **in the same order**, and
runs the promises concurrently.

## Getting started

To get started, we need a function that matches the signature of `Promise.all`,
i.e. one that accepts a list of promises and returns a promise. We're using the
`Promise` constructor here as it allows us to manually resolve the promise
whenever we want with its executor function (the function argument that you pass
to `new Promise`). For now, we'll resolve the promise immediately with an empty
array and for the majority of the article we'll be working out of the executor
function.

```ts
type PromiseAllResult<Promises extends readonly unknown[] | []> = Promise<{
  -readonly [K in keyof Promises]: Awaited<Promises[K]>
}>

const myPromiseAll = <Promises extends readonly unknown[] | []>(
  promises: Promises
): PromiseAllResult<Promises> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve([] as unknown as Awaited<PromiseAllResult<Promises>>)
  })
}
```

    The types above may seem overly complex, but they're required to make sure
    types _flow through_ the function. They make sure that the function's output 
    is correctly typed and are exactly the same as the real `Promise.all`'s types. 
    Here's my best attempt at an explanation of the more confusing parts:

    * We need a generic so that the output types can match the input types. The `Promises`
      type argument extends `readonly unknown[]` to ensure that the input is an array.
      We mark the array type as `readonly` as it allows the function's types to
      [work with a wider variety of inputs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/MYewdgzgLgBATgUwIYBNwBsCeBBOcmYCMMAvDANqEA0MATALoxIQyiRQCwAUG9PMmjBZc+TLQBcMAEoCMOPAQA8YAK4BbAEYI4APlIVqdegG5u3XrDWYACnBBqAlhATZ06YmUW37ThCwQAHlAIYCgsMqhyIkoqYADWYCAA7mB6AD4U9DoAFNwwMAAOdo7OEJLeJX7cAJTlxb6KAN4wALSIkUKYFADSMA5gMHEImCAAZjAVvhD0kthJSA7BKF71peTdWTAAvnokeo15-FAqcAONW0wsSGCY3FtmXFaTzq7u2e2CwgpE1dxPqy43IR3rJOtExL8uA8LDB-j4Xm5aPoVvC-DBAsFQixYglkmByIwMgScociqiyhMARAanVUU1Wh85D0+gMhiNxs8-DMYHMFksUZUIOtNjtSPtDohjqcYOdLkwbnduAB6JUwAByIGCMCgAAsEOi8CA4Cw9Yg-jYAa9aCCOl9RIRIXDKlabZ95KJaNUgA).
      The additional `| []` allows the types of tuple elements to flow through the function
      too. Finally, we use `unknown` instead of `any` as it prevents us from accidentally
      making mistakes in the function body.
    * In the output type we use a [mapped type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html)
      which allows for correct output types when using tuples. The `-readonly` in the mapped
      type makes the resulting type **not** readonly, and `Awaited` unwraps promise types,
      converted something like `Promise<number>` to `number`.

Let's now extract out the results array so that we can easily set values in
later steps:

```ts
// ...
const results = [] as unknown as Awaited<PromiseAllResult<Promises>>
resolve(results)
```

## The naïve approach

A first implementation might look like this:

```ts {4-8} jsKeepLines
// ...
const results = [] as unknown as Awaited<PromiseAllResult<Promises>>

for (const promise of promises) {
  promise.then(promiseResult => {
    results.push(promiseResult as any)
  })
}

resolve(results)
```

This has a very big problem however. Promises are _asynchronous_, so the
function we pass to `.then` will not be called immediately and calling `resolve`
right after the for-loop means the promise gets resolved with an empty array. In
the demo below you probably won't even see the `Loading...` text due to how
immediately `myPromiseAll` resolves.

import { NaiveExample } from './components'

<Demo component={NaiveExample} />

Instead, we need some way of knowing when all the promises are complete and only
then `resolve`-ing the promise.

## Waiting for all the promises to finish

We can make sure all promises are complete by only `resolve`-ing our promise
when the number of results we have equals the number of promises provided.

```ts {8-10} jsKeepLines
// ...
const results = [] as unknown as Awaited<PromiseAllResult<Promises>>

for (const promise of promises) {
  promise.then(promiseResult => {
    results.push(promiseResult as any)

    if (results.length === promises.length) {
      resolve(results)
    }
  })
}
```

... and now this works! We're waiting for all the promises to complete before
`resolve`-ing, so all the results are available `myPromiseAll` resolves.

However, we have one big problem: the results are sometimes _in the wrong
order_:

import { WaitingForAllPromisesExample } from './components'

<Demo component={WaitingForAllPromisesExample} />

## Setting results in the right order

Making sure results end up in the right order requires a bit of a refactor -
we'll need to:

1. initialise the `results` array to be the same length as the input `promises`
   array.
2. know the index of each promise so we can set its result in the correct
   position in the output array.
3. separately keep track of how many promises have been resolved as point `1.`
   means that `results.length` will _always_ be the same as `promises.length`.

```ts {2-5,7-8,10-11,13} jsLines="2,4,6-7,9-10,12"
// ...
const results = Array(promises.length) as unknown as Awaited<
  PromiseAllResult<Promises>
>
let numResolvedPromises = 0

for (let i = 0; i < promises.length; i++) {
  const promise = promises[i]
  promise.then(promiseResult => {
    results[i] = promiseResult as any
    numResolvedPromises++

    if (numResolvedPromises === promises.length) {
      resolve(results)
    }
  })
}
```

We can now see that the order of results of our `myPromiseAll` function is
consistently the same as `Promise.all`:

import { InOrderExample } from './components'

<Demo component={InOrderExample} />

## Handling errors

So far, we've handled everything going well, but we haven't handled any errors
yet. `Promise.all` throws an error if _any of the provided promises reject_. We
can accomplish this by calling `reject` with the error when any of the provided
promises throw:

```ts {18-20} jsLines="17-19"
// ...
const results = Array(promises.length) as unknown as Awaited<
  PromiseAllResult<Promises>
>
let numResolvedPromises = 0

for (let i = 0; i < promises.length; i++) {
  const promise = promises[i]
  promise
    .then(promiseResult => {
      results[i] = promiseResult as any
      numResolvedPromises++

      if (numResolvedPromises === promises.length) {
        resolve(results)
      }
    })
    .catch((error: unknown) => {
      reject(error)
    })
}
```

Now, this is fine - the `Promise` constructor only accepts the first `resolve`,
or `reject`, and any other times the functions are called are ignored. However,
if you're like me, you'd like some extra confirmation that nothing goes wrong:

```ts {6,12,18,22,25} jsLines="5,11,17,21,24"
// ...
const results = Array(promises.length) as unknown as Awaited<
  PromiseAllResult<Promises>
>
let numResolvedPromises = 0
let settled = false

for (let i = 0; i < promises.length; i++) {
  const promise = promises[i]
  promise
    .then(promiseResult => {
      if (settled) return
      results[i] = promiseResult as any
      numResolvedPromises++

      if (numResolvedPromises === promises.length) {
        settled = true
        resolve(results)
      }
    })
    .catch((error: unknown) => {
      if (settled) return

      settled = true
      reject(error)
    })
}
```

## Handling non-promises

We're now almost done. One last minor thing we need to do is handle when an
element in the promises array isn't a promise. When `Promise.all` encounters a
value that isn't a promise, it still works while our `myPromiseAll` so far would
throw an error. We can fix this by wrapping each item in a promise that resolves
immediately with `Promise.resolve`:

```ts {3}
// ...
for (let i = 0; i < promises.length; i++) {
  const promise = Promise.resolve(promises[i])
  // ...
}
```

## All together

Here's the entire code for `myPromiseAll`:

```ts truncate
type PromiseAllResult<Promises extends readonly unknown[] | []> = Promise<{
  -readonly [K in keyof Promises]: Awaited<Promises[K]>
}>

const myPromiseAll = <Promises extends readonly unknown[] | []>(
  promises: Promises
): PromiseAllResult<Promises> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const results = Array(promises.length) as unknown as Awaited<
      PromiseAllResult<Promises>
    >
    let numResolvedPromises = 0
    let settled = false

    for (let i = 0; i < promises.length; i++) {
      const promise = Promise.resolve(promises[i])
      promise
        .then(promiseResult => {
          if (settled) return
          results[i] = promiseResult as any
          numResolvedPromises++

          if (numResolvedPromises === promises.length) {
            settled = true
            resolve(results)
          }
        })
        .catch((error: unknown) => {
          if (settled) return

          settled = true
          reject(error)
        })
    }
  })
}
```
