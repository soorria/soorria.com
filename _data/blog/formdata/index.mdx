Of the hundreds of [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)
available in browsers and some server-side runtimes, the
[FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) class is
one of my favourites.

## tl;dr

1. Use a `<form>`.
2. Add `names`s to all your inputs - most inputs should have unique names. All
   inputs with `type="checkbox"` or `type="radio"` should have the same name for
   logical groups, and should have `value`s.
3. Construct a `FormData` object with the form as an argument:
   `new FormData(form)`.
4. Use the `get` and `getAll` methods to access any values you need!

## Using it

At first blush, the
[methods available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)
see kinda useless - why use `FormData.get` and `FormData.set` when `Map`s do the
exact same thing, and plain old objects can do basically the same thing with an
arguable simpler interface? The real power of `FormData` comes when used with
the `<form>` element. Take the simple register form below:

```html truncate title="Register Form Before FormData"
<form id="register-form">
  <!-- Email Input -->
  <div>
    <label for="register-email">Email</label>
    <input type="email" id="register-email" required />
  </div>

  <!-- Password Input -->
  <div>
    <label for="register-password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" id="register-password" required />
  </div>

  <!-- Mailing Lists -->
  <fieldset>
    <legend>
      <p>Select the email lists you want to subscribe to</p>
    </legend>

    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="register-mailing-marketing" />
      Marketing Emails
    </label>

    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="register-mailing-blog" />
      Blog Notifications
    </label>

    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="register-mailing-spam" />
      Constant Spam
    </label>
  </fieldset>

  <button type="submit">Register</button>
</form>
```

When the form is submitted you'll need to get the values with JavaScript, which
you might do like this:

```ts title="Form Submission w/o FormData"
const registerForm: HTMLFormElement = document.getElementById('register-form')
const emailInput: HTMLInputElement = document.getElementById('register-email')
const passwordInput: HTMLInputElement =
  document.getElementById('register-password')
const marketingMailingInput: HTMLInputElement = document.getElementById(
  'register-mailing-marketing'
)
const blogMailingInput: HTMLInputElement = document.getElementById(
  'register-mailing-blog'
)
const spamMailingInput: HTMLInputElement = document.getElementById(
  'register-mailing-spam'
)

registerForm.addEventListener('submit', event => {
  // Remember to prevent the default <form> submission behaviour
  // if you're handling submissions with JavaScript!
  event.preventDefault()

  const email = emailInput.value
  const password = passwordInput.value

  const acceptedMailingLists = []

  if (marketingMailingInput.checked) {
    acceptedMailingLists.push('marketing')
  }
  if (blogMailingInput.checked) {
    acceptedMailingLists.push('blog')
  }
  if (spamMailingInput.checked) {
    acceptedMailingLists.push('spam')
  }

  doRegister(email, password, acceptedMailingLists)
})
```

This doesn't look _that_ bad, but it's a lot of work that we could avoid.
Consider (almost) the same script but now using `FormData`:

```ts title="Form Submission with FormData" {7-12}
const registerForm: HTMLFormElement = document.getElementById('register-form')

registerForm.addEventListener('submit', event => {
  // Remember to prevent the default <form> submission behaviour
  // if you're handling submissions with JavaScript!
  event.preventDefault()

  const formData = new FormData(registerForm)

  const email = formData.get('email')
  const password = formData.get('password')

  const acceptedMailingLists = formData.getAll('mailing-lists')

  doRegister(email, password, acceptedMailingLists)
})
```

This is good, but there's one pretty big issue with this that I haven't
mentioned yet, which leads into the a (kind of) downside with using `FormData`.
The code above _doesn't work_ - not because I suck at JavaScript or because
FormData is too bleeding edge, but because we need to update the origina HTML to
work with `FormData`, and _be more correct_.

In the code snippet above, we used a few strings as arguments to `formData.get`
and `formData.getAll`, but where do these come from? When you use create a
`FormData` object with a `form`, the keys we use in `get` and `getAll` map to
the `name` attribute for any `<input>`s, `<select>`s, and `<textarea>`s inside
the `<form>`. We can fix this issue by adding `name`s to the inputs and adding
`value`s to the `<input>`s with `type="checkbox"`:

```html truncate title="Register Form After FormData :)"
<form id="register-form">
  <!-- Email Input -->
  <div>
    <label for="register-email">Email</label>
    <input name="email" type="email" id="register-email" required />
  </div>

  <!-- Password Input -->
  <div>
    <label for="register-password">Password</label>
    <input name="password" type="password" id="register-password" required />
  </div>

  <!-- Mailing Lists -->
  <fieldset>
    <legend>
      <p>Select the email lists you want to subscribe to</p>
    </legend>

    <label>
      <input
        name="mailing-lists"
        value="marketing"
        type="checkbox"
        id="register-mailing-marketing"
      />
      Marketing Emails
    </label>

    <label>
      <input
        name="mailing-lists"
        value="blog"
        type="checkbox"
        id="register-mailing-blog"
      />
      Blog Notifications
    </label>

    <label>
      <input
        name="mailing-lists"
        value="spam"
        type="checkbox"
        id="register-mailing-spam"
      />
      Constant Spam
    </label>
  </fieldset>

  <button type="submit">Register</button>
</form>
```

If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you'll notice that all the checkbox
`<input>`s all have the same `name`, and they each have a `value`. As mentioned
before, the `name` is how `FormData` knows what to associate the input's value
with, but when there are multiple inputs with the same `name`, we can get the
values for all of them with `getAll`. Now, to know which checkbox have been
selected, we give them unique `value`s.

After making the changes above, everything works! Here's a demo of the complete
code in a CodeSandbox:

<Sandbox
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/blog-formData-after-formData-ghst14?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&file=src/index.js&view=preview"
  title="blog/formData - after FormData :)"
/>

## React and Other Frameworks

If you've used React, you might notice a little issue with the using the code
above - React doesn't (directly) give you access to the DOM elements created.
You could use this weird hacky hook called `useRef`, but there's simpler
solution. In fact, you can use this approach in _any_ framework where you have
access to the `<form>`s submission event. We can use the `currentTarget`
property on methods to get access to the element that we added an event listener
to, so `currentTarget` for a submit event will be the form! Here's what a
simplified React component using `FormData` would look like:

```tsx title="FormData in React" {8}
import type React from 'react'

export const ExampleForm: React.FC = () => {
  const handleSubmit: FormEventHandler<HTMLFormElement> = event => {
    // Remember to prevent the default <form> submission behaviour
    // if you're handling submissions with JavaScript!
    event.preventDefault()

    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)

    const email = formData.get('email')
    const password = formData.get('password')

    const acceptedMailingLists = formData.getAll('mailing-lists')

    doRegister(email, password, acceptedMailingLists)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Same form contents as the HTML form above */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

Notice how there aren't any `useState`s and you don't need to manually wire up
`value` and `onChange` to control and get values for all of the inputs!

## `fetch`ing with `FormData`

When you need to make a `fetch` request the values from form, you'll often get
the specific values you need (as above), and make a request using them. However,
if your API accepts `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`
mime types for the request body (i.e. accepts those values for `Content-Type`),
you can set the `body` of a `fetch` request to the FormData directly! Doing this
also automatically adds the correct `Content-Type` header to your request.

```ts
const formData = new FormData(document.getElementById('register-form'))

fetch('/your-endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
})
```

This is also the only way I know of right now that allows you to send or upload
_multiple_ files in a network request!

## On the Server

<Note variant="warning">
  The following will work only if the HTTP request has the `Content-Type` header
  set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`. If the
  header has a different value, or is unset an error will be thrown.
</Note>

If you use a server-side framework / environment that uses Web API `Request`s
(such as
[Next.js' middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware),
[Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Astro](https://astro.build)), you can use
`FormData` on there too! `Request`s have a `formData` method that parses the
request body as a `FormData` object, similar to how `Response.json()` parses a
response's body as JSON.

For example, in Remix your `action`s have access to the request and you can
access its body as a `FormData` object:

```ts {4,6-7,9}
import type { ActionArgs } from 'remix'

// This runs on the server!
export const action = async ({ request }: ActionArgs) => {
  const formData = await request.formData()

  const email = formData.get('email')
  const password = formData.get('password')

  const acceptedMailingLists = formData.getAll('mailing-lists')

  db.createAccount(email, password, acceptedMailingLists)
}
```

## A (Somewhat) Nice Hack

<Note variant="warning">
  The following will only works well if every input in your form has different
  `name` attributes, and so doesn't really support inputs with
  `type="checkbox"`.
</Note>

`FormData`'s interface is great, but sometimes you just need object to do the
job. The following snippet converts a `FormData` to a plain JavaScript object
where the keys and values correspond to those in your `FormData`.

```ts
const formData = new FormData(document.getElementById('register-form'))
const dataAsObject = Object.fromEntries(formData as any)
```

<Note variant="warning">
  For at least version `4.8.4` and earlier, TypeScript doesn't recognise the
  required properties on `FormData` even though they're widely implemented so
  you need to case the object with `as any`.
</Note>

## Conclusion

`FormData` is great. Use it if you can.
