Set, get and remove a
[CSS custom property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
from the comfort of a React component. This _could_ result in slightly more performant code when
you're setting the `style` property directly since React will re-run your component fewer times.

```typescript
import { useMemo, useEffect } from 'react'

type UseCssVarProps = {
  name: string
  root?: HTMLElement
}

type CssVarControls = {
  set: (value: string) => void
  get: () => string
  remove: () => void
}

export const useCssVar = ({ name, root = document.body }: UseCssVarProps): CssVarControls => {
  const controls: CssVarControls = useMemo(
    () => ({
      set: value => root.style.setProperty(name, value),
      get: () => root.style.getPropertyValue(name),
      remove: () => root.style.removeProperty(name),
    }),
    [name, root]
  )

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => controls.remove()
  }, [controls])

  return controls
}
```

**Note**:

- We use `useMemo`, so that if you follow hook rules and use the helpers in a function inside a
  `useEffect` , `useCallback`, etc, you won't have code (re-)running unnecessarily.

- If you don't want the variable to be removed when the hook is no longer used, you can either
  remove the `useEffect`, or add an extra prop and conditionally return a cleanup function in the
  `useEffect`.

- This hook doesn't use `useState` since it would nullify the performance aspect, and I didn't feel
  the need to be notified when the variable changed on the root. You could use
  [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) if you
  wanted to know if the variable was updated on the `root`.

## Demo

import { Example, EXAMPLE_CSS_VAR, EXAMPLE_TRANSFORM } from './components'

If you open up your browser's devtools, find the `<main>` element and look at its `style` attribute,
you'll see the <code>{EXAMPLE_CSS_VAR}</code> CSS variable change as you change the input's value or
press the button.

The image's rotation is handled by styling it with <code>transform: {EXAMPLE_TRANSFORM}</code>.

<Demo component={Example} />
