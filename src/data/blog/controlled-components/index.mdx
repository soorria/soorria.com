  Follow me down a rabbit hole to understand how React works slightly
  differently to every other framework.

I got nerd-sniped by a bug in a unit test for a Vue component, and 4 months
later this baby exists. The title is only _kind of_ a lie - basically every
frontend framework has controlled inputs, but none of them do what exactly React
does.

## What are "controlled inputs"?

Whether an input (or more generally a component) is "controlled" or
"uncontrolled" depends on where its state is managed.

**Controlled components** have their state managed by their consumers, and
passed down as props. This means that the consumer of a controlled component can
force it into a specific state. For `<input>`s this often looks like a `value`
prop and an `onChange` event listener:

```tsx title="controlled-input.tsx" nojs
import { useState } from 'react'

export function ControlledInputExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  return (
    <input
      // we're setting the input's value here, so if `setValue` is
      // called, the text displayed by the input will update.
      value={value}
      onChange={event => {
        setValue(event.currentTarget.value)
      }}
    ></input>
  )
}
```

**Uncontrolled** components manage their state internally, and consumers cannot
easily force the component into a specific state. Sometimes, you'll be able to
set default values, e.g. using the `defaultValue` prop on `<input>`s, and often
uncontrolled components will emit events to expose some or all of their internal
state, e.g. `onChange`. You can also access the values of native inputs using
`ref`s or by using [`FormData`](/blog/formdata) on a surrounding form. Here's an
example of an uncontrolled `<input>`:

```tsx title="uncontrolled-input.tsx" nojs
import { useState } from 'react'

export function UncontrolledInputExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  return (
    <input
      // Note that we're NOT setting the input's `value` here, just
      // the `defaultValue`. If `setValue` is called,  the text
      // displayed by this input WILL NOT change!
      defaultValue={value}
      onChange={event => {
        setValue(event.currentTarget.value)
      }}
    ></input>
  )
}
```

## How are controlled inputs different across frameworks?

Let's look at how the following `ControlledInput` component behaves across
frameworks:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function removeVowels(message) {
  return message.replaceAll(/[aeiou]/gi, '')
}

export default function ControlledInput() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('rhythm')

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={cleanedMessage}
        onChange={event => {
          const messageFromInput = event.currentTarget.value
          const cleanedMessage = removeVowels(messageFromInput)
          setMessage(cleanedMessage)
        }}
      ></input>
    </>
  )
}
```

The above component contains an input bound to a piece of state using an
`onChange` event listener. The value of the input has all its vowels removed
before state is updated. The transformation of the value is arbitrary, and other
examples include converting it to snake_case, but it's important as it
highlights the differences between frameworks' handling of controlled inputs.

Using [Astro](https://astro.build), I've implemented the above component in
React, Preact, Solid.js, Vue, and Svelte - play around with the demo below, and
see if you can figure out the difference between React and the other frameworks!

<Sandbox
  title="Framework controlled component comparison"
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/controlled-inputs?ctl=1&embed=1&hideExplorer=1&hideNavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
/>

In all of the above frameworks, entering consonants only (e.g. type out
"rhythm") behaves the same across frameworks. This is expected as there's no
transformation applied to the text (i.e. vowels aren't removed since there
aren't any).

If you enter text that contains vowels, you might notice a _slight_ difference
between React and the other frameworks. Try entering some text that contains
several consecutive vowels, for example "yeeeet". As you type out the first "e",
you'll noticed that in non-React frameworks it stays rendered in the input, but
has not been set in state. If you add more "e"s, you'll notice that they still
stay there! When you add another consonant, "t", the errant "e"s disappear and
the text rendered in the input becomes "yt". However in React, as you type out
"yeeee", the text rendered in the input stays as "y".

The main difference here is that in the non-React frameworks, the value of the
input is only set when the value in state changes, whereas React forces the
value of the input to match the state!

### How does React do it?

React adds event listeners to handle relevant events for `<input>`,
`<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements using
[<Sparkles> _event delegation_</Sparkles>](#event-delegation). After all your
`onChange`s and other event handlers finish running, all controlled input
elements have their values re-set to that of the element's `value` prop!

You can see exactly what React does in the source:

1. React sets up all global event listeners for the events that get handled by
   `onChange`:
   https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cd22717c274061fd7dc13cd6eaff10e6a3946508/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/events/plugins/ChangeEventPlugin.js#L38-L47
2. After all synchronous code for `onChange` handlers is run, React "restores"
   the state of `<input>`s, `<textarea>`s, and `<select>`s:
   https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cd22717c274061fd7dc13cd6eaff10e6a3946508/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/events/ReactDOMUpdateBatching.js#L42
3. React sets the value of input elements:
   https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/9eabb37338e6bea18441dec58a4284fe00ee09ae/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactDOMInput.js#L85

<Note variant="info" id="event-delegation" title="What is event delegation?">

I've written a long-ish [post about event delegation](/blog/event-delegation)
before, but the gist is that instead of adding an event listener on every
element, you can add a single event listener per-event on a common parent
element and manually route the event to the correct element. This is why when
you `console.log` events in React, you see a `SyntheticEvent` rather than the
raw event!

</Note>

## Opinion time!

Is what React does a good thing?

kinda ðŸ™‚

React does a lot of things to make web development simpler and more intuitive
for developers, but it can often result in developers being "React developers"
vs web developers who use React. This doesn't apply only to React, but many
developers end up only learning how to solve problems using a framework or
library, and become significantly less effective when without!

Overall, I think this is ok as long as developers are aware of the difference
between React and how HTML elements & the DOM work in general.

Is what React does a good thing?

- forcing inputs' values to match their `value` props makes things more
  intuitive
- not how things work in general
- but react does patch over other things to make things a bit easier / more
  intuitive, e.g.
  - oninput, onchange, etc -> onChange
  - whitespace in jsx isn't preserved - only in the strings you add, unlike in
    html
- this makes things easier, but could lead to people becoming "React" developers
  vs web developers - i.e. people learning the framework instead of learning the
  platform
- more of a JSX thing, but self-closing tags work different:

## Conclusion

React forces the value of inputs to match the `value` prop if set, while other
frameworks only update the value of an input if its `value` prop changes. This
can lead to subtle differences in what users see and expect out of your apps,
but not necessarily what actually happens.
