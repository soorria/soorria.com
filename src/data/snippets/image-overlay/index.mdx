CSS-only method to overlay an image on an html page. Very useful if you need to
almost identially copy a design from an image for some reason.

```css
body {
  position: relative;
}

body::after {
  content: '';
  background-image: url('./path/to/image.png');
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  opacity: 0.5;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 999998;
}
```

<Note variant="info">

If you need your `<body>` to be a specific width and height, you can set it with
CSS in the top rule above.
