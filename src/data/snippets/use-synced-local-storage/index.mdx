Save state to localStorage and sync it between components, custom hooks, tabs
and windows! It also has an almost identical interface to `useState`.

This is an extended & more advanced version of
[`useLocalStorage`](/snippets/use-local-storage) that adds the following
features:

- SSR / SSG support (defaults to `initialValue` on the server, and on initial
  render to prevent react's hydration warnings)
- Synchronisation of state for `key` across `useSyncedLocalStorage` instances in
  the same / different tabs and between windows of the same app.

However, it comes with the cost of being larger, doing more work, and having a
dependency.

```ts
import type { Dispatch, SetStateAction } from 'react'
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'
import mitt from 'mitt'

const em = mitt<Record<string, any>>()

// Store which keys are tracked so we don't do unnecessary work for other uses of localStorage
const trackedKeys: Record<string, number> = {}

// This block relies on window, so to make sure it only runs on the client
// we need to icheck if `window` is defined
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  // We define this globally since it simplifies the already extremely
  // complicated hook a tiny bit, and we can handle it all in one event handler
  window.addEventListener('storage', event => {
    if (
      // the `storage` event also fires for `sessonStorage`, and we don't care about that for this hook
      event.storageArea === localStorage &&
      // Intentionally using `!=` instead of `!==` since it checks `null` and `undefined`
      event.key != null &&
      trackedKeys[event.key]
    ) {
      let parsed
      try {
        parsed = JSON.parse(event.newValue ?? '') as unknown
      } catch {
        parsed = null
      }
      em.emit(event.key, event.newValue == null ? null : parsed)
    }
  })

  // Same as above  - we can handle setting localStorage all in one spot.
  em.on('*', (key, data) => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(data))
  })
}

type JsonValue = NonNullJsonValue | null

type NonNullJsonValue =
  | string
  | number
  | boolean
  | { [key: string]: JsonValue }
  | JsonValue[]

export const useSyncedLocalStorage = <
  T extends NonNullJsonValue = NonNullJsonValue,
>(
  key: string,
  initialValue: T
): [T, Dispatch<SetStateAction<T>>] => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<T>(initialValue)
  const initialised = useRef(false)
  const shouldSync = useRef(false)
  const emitting = useRef(false)
  const initialValueRef = useRef(initialValue)

  useEffect(() => {
    initialValueRef.current = initialValue
  }, [initialValue])

  useEffect(() => {
    trackedKeys[key] = (trackedKeys[key] ?? 0) + 1
    return () => {
      trackedKeys[key]--
    }
  }, [key])

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialised.current) return
    initialised.current = true

    const cached = localStorage.getItem(key)

    if (!cached) {
      setState(initialValueRef.current)
      return
    }

    try {
      setState(JSON.parse(cached) as T)
    } catch (err) {
      setState(initialValueRef.current)
    }
  }, [key])

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = (data: T | null) => {
      // If this hook is the one that sent the message, just ignore it
      if (!emitting.current) {
        shouldSync.current = false
        setState(data ?? initialValueRef.current)
      }
    }

    em.on(key, handler)

    return () => {
      em.off(key, handler)
    }
  }, [key])

  useEffect(() => {
    // Prevents this hook from re-sending an update
    if (!shouldSync.current) {
      shouldSync.current = true
      return
    }

    // Prevents this hook from setting itself again
    emitting.current = true
    em.emit(key, state)
    emitting.current = false
  }, [state, key])

  return [state, setState]
}
```

<Note variant='info'>

- This hook relies on the [`mitt`](https://github.com/developit/mitt) event
  emitter package - it's tiny at only 200 bytes(!!) that I would have had to
  include anyway (for syncing between hook instances in the same tab), and has
  [tests](https://github.com/developit/mitt/blob/main/test/index_test.ts) that I
  don't want to write.

<Note variant='warning'>

- The type of the `state` that you use this hook with cannot be nullable (i.e.
  cannot be `null` or `undefined`) - and must be something that can be
  serialised as JSON (you can't used things like `Set` or `Map`). This is
  enforced in the type signature of the hook so if you're using TypeScript,
  issues should be caught at compile-time. If you do want the value to be
  nullable, I recommend wrapping your state in an object (e.g.
  `useSyncedLocalStorage<{ user: User | null }>('user', { user: null })`), or
  you can modify the hook to suit your needs.

- Unfortunately we have 4 refs of which none are used for DOM elements, and I'm
  not sure of a better way to get around the issues they solve without adding
  extra state
